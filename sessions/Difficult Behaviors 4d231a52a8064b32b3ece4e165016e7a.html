      Argumentative people:

    </h2>

     A healthy argument is good for reaching a consensus, however, if it escalates to arguing over minuscule detail, or a refusal to compromise, the best course of action is to point out the unproductive nature of the argument. Putting the argument to the wider group can also help stem a heated argument by reaching a group consensus.

    </h2>
    <p id="c910b360-1f59-481d-8830-8adc907c57d6">
     These types of people are usually poor listeners, and are unaware of the effect they have on others. Look for a place to intervene and ask for other&rsquo;s opinions. You can neutralize this type of person by politely ignoring their efforts to speak.

     When people have a conversation amongst themselves, it can be highly disruptive. This can be quickly remedied by being quiet, and patiently waiting for them to realize everyone is waiting for them to stop talking.
