     Ice breakers can feel a bit awkward, but running a session with an unfamiliar group who don't feel comfortable sharing ideas is far worse. By encouraging people to build rapport with each other, and setting the tone for an activity-led meeting, you can have a more productive session.

     Tips:
    </h2>
    <p id="eea612b9-8e1e-4c31-8a5f-d5997c402765">
     Don't spend too long using Ice Breakers. The meeting should warm up on its own naturally, but just one small exercise at the start can make all the difference.
