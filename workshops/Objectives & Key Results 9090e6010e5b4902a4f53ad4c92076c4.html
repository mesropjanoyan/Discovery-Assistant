     Test your OKR metric by pretending you&rsquo;re mid-way through the next quarter. Does this metric help you decide what to do this week? Or does it feel irrelevant in the context of your &ldquo;real&rdquo; goals? If you don&rsquo;t think it would feel important to talk about this every week, pick something else.

      How to create and use the OKR template board
     </strong>
    </h2>
    <p id="fedb0d7f-c172-4636-a806-bba93158cd52">
     The OKR Board is the magic sauce that makes your team&rsquo;s objectives work. It is a weekly conversation tool to check into your objectives, check team health and manage priorities and upcoming tasks.

    <p id="59c13344-e6ce-4d93-a948-2dd6e7586445">
     Use the board as a stand-up meeting every Monday, and briefly go over each quadrant. Fridays should be used to celebrate what the team has achieved toward the objective. For OKRs to be successful, this regular rhythm of checking in is vital. Without it, focus and alignment is lost. Have your OKR Board clearly visible to make this as easy as possible.
    </p>
    <p id="f54cdbf4-89d8-4dc0-86de-53bcaf98ce65">
     You don't have to determine what goes in these quadrants in the OKR workshop, but if you have time - it is worth establishing

     Health metrics are the things you want to make sure your team is not letting slip. These are the things critical to the survival of the team and the product. For example, code quality or team morale. Check in to the health metrics and determine if there are any changes (red, amber, green). If there are, learn why they&rsquo;ve changed and work out how to improve them.

     Check in to your confidence levels of achieving the key results in the quarter (they start at 5/10). Discuss if they&rsquo;ve gone up or down since last week and why. Measure confidence, not progress. Progress doesn&rsquo;t tell you how the team is feeling or how effective you have been so far.

     When your weekly check-ins run like clockwork, your health metrics are largely moving in the right direction and you are making clear progress, you can safely assume that your OKR workshop has done the trick.
    </p>
    <p id="4f3670b2-a914-4557-ad70-bacec4268b32">
     This doesn&rsquo;t mean you can rest on your laurels. Keep an eye out for distractions and diversions. Run an OKR workshop once a quarter to re-evaluate or adjust your OKRs, or to set new ones if you have achieved the ones you were working towards.
