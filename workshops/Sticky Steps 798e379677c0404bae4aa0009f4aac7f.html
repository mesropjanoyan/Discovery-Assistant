     This workshop is great for giving you a clear plan for achieving your goal. By working backwards, step by step, from the goal itself, you can turn seemingly unachievable goals into a tangible reality, with a step-by-step pathway to get you there.

     Tips:
    </h2>
    <p id="0502c92b-6329-48ee-9f4d-d91291e36496">
     As you step backwards through your plan, you might find certain steps that need to happen simultaneously. This may cause your plan to split and branch out to two paths running side by side.
    </p>
    <p id="f581cfe2-6d1b-48ef-ad15-93fa4d81df53">
     This is fine, but at all times try to consider if each step is absolutely necessary to achieving the desired end-state. The more linear your path, the easier it will be to achieve your goal.
